# Welcome to the .dotfiles of my Archlinux DWL setup

After 15 years on i3 it was time to migrate to a Wayland compositor.  I always loved the suckless  philosophy and that's why I chose DWL.

## What is DWL?
DWL is a compact, hackable compositor for Wayland based on wlroots. It is intended to fill the same space in the Wayland world that dwm does in X11, primarily in terms of functionality, and secondarily in terms of philosophy. Like DWM, DWL is:

- Easy to understand, hack on, and extend with patches
* One C source file (or a very small number) configurable via config.h
+ Tied to as few external dependencies as possible
